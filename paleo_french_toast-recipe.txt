Paleo French Toast Bread Pudding

Ingredients

Bread:
blanched almond flour - 1-1/2 cups
arrowroot starch - 1/2 cup
baking powder - 1 teaspoon
salt - 1/2 teaspoon
eggs - 3
coconut oil - 3 tablespoons, melted
raw honey - 2 tablespoons
apple cider vinegar - 1/2 teaspoon


Pudding:
raisins - 1/4 cup
canned full-fat coconut milk - 1 cup
eggs - 3
raw honey - 1/4 cup
ground cinnamon - 2 teaspoons
ground nutmeg - 1/2 teaspoon
pure vanilla extract - 1/2 teaspoon


Instructions

To make the bread: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. To a large mixing bowl, add the almond flour, arrowroot flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well. To a smaller mixing bowl, add the eggs, coconut oil, honey, and vinegar. Mix well. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry. Pour into a well-greased 8x8 inch glass baking dish. Bake for 18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean and bread is lightly browned (it looks kind of like cornbread). To make the bread pudding: Turn the oven down to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove the bread from the baking dish and cut into cubes. Place cubed bread back in the baking dish. Gently toss the bread with the raisins and evenly spread the bread in the baking dish. To a medium-sized mixing-bowl, add the coconut milk, eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Pour evenly over bread in baking dish and press bread down into liquid with a fork to make sure all the bread is soaking in the liquid. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread pudding comes out clean. Serve with whipped cream and warm maple syrup.
